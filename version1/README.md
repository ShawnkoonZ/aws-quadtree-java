# Version 1.

> Idea : `Generates QuadTree && outputs it out into csv file.`

> Algorithm : `Recursive solution for building a tree.`

> Possible Idea : `Upload files up to S3 in async && let docker containers process them`


## Cons

> Tree Nodes are not generated in level order.

> `Fix` : Use different algorithm that can generate quadtree in level order.
